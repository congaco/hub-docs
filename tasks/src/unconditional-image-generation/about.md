## Use cases
In the cartoon anime industry, it is normally time-consuming to draw images of characters, objects 
as well as landscapes because there is a huge demand on images and every little detail of each image
needs to be taken into account. Furthermore, hiring high qualified artists cannot always be possible. 
In this case, unconditional image generation models can be used to generate many anime images economically.

Choosing a hairstyle or makeup that fit one's face is not always easy without trying them before. 
These models can help with this by generating images with different hairstyle or makeup from input ones in advance.

One can also gain higher quality of input images with the help of these models.
